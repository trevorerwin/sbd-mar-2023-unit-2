# Variables

Variables are used to store and to point to things in memory.We can reference it later in our script

Ex. Algebra

```js
x = 15
x + 5 = ? //20
```

In JS, all variables must have `unique names`

### Rules for naming

- can contain letters, numbers, underscores
- MUST begin with a letter
- can begin with dollar sign or underscore (not really used)
- names are case sensitive
- reserve words CANNOT be used (class, let, const, var, etc.)
